<h1><b>CS1027b Computer Science Fundamentals II</b></h1>
<h2><b>Assignment 3</b></h2>
</CENTER>

<p>Due Tuesday, March 10th, 11:55pm via Owl.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p> 
Simulation is a good method for evaluating supermarket checkout strategies.
Which is best: a single queue feeding all checkout counters, a single regular
queue feeding each checkout counter (all of equal status) and a 
number of express checkout counters (for customers buying 12 or fewer items)
and the rest being regular checkout queues. Using realistic assumptions
about customer arrival time, mean number of item to purchase, etc. it is possible
to simulate the checkout process to determine which setup provides the
minimum average (weighted by number of items) waiting customer times. 
The important thing in the above brief description of simulation is
that one or more queues must be used. This assignment focuses on manipulation
of a single event queue for a supermarket counter setup.
</p>

<p>
During simulation, we must be able to determine the next event that will occur.
The problem is this event may not be the first event on the queue. One way
to handle this problem is to use a <code>priority queue</code>. This strategy
uses a heap to provide <code>O(log(n))</code> enqueuing and dequeuing 
operations for queues of size n.
There are Java classes that implement this but for this assignment we will
use <code>O(n)</code> enqueueing and dequeueing operations implemented using our QueueADT class.
</p>

<h2>Functional Specifications</h2>

<p>
You are provided with a zip file 
<a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/courses/CS1027b/assignments/Asn1/ass3Files.zip">ass3Files.zip</a>
which contains a number of classes. 
I/O is done as on assignment 1, by using the <code>InStringFile.java</code> class.
The standard class for queueing as presented in class, <code>LinkedQueue</code>,
<code>QueueADT</code>, <code>LinearNode</code> are also provided.
</p>

<p>
An <code>Event</code> class is provided that gives the definition of an event.
Its has fields for time (double), type (String) and number of items (int).
It has the appropriate getters and setters and a <code>toString()</code>  method.
This class uses the <code>Service.java</code> class for a method called 
<code>doubleFormat</code> used in Event's <code>toString()</code> method (to
perform minor pretty printing). Both
of these classes are complete and do not need any modifications.
</p>

<p>  A complete <code>Main.java</code> class is also provided. 
The static <code>main</code> method reads an event file, from argvs[0], for example
<code>little_ass3_events2015.txt</code> or <code>ass3_events2015.txt</code>.
This is an unordered queue of events. Each event has an eventTime field (double) and
an eventType field (String, one of ARRIVAL, IN_SERVICE, DEPART, SNAPSHOT and ALL_DONE).
The ARRIVAL, IN_SERVICE and DEPART events represent a customer's arrival at a checkout counter,
the customer being served at the counter and the customer leaving the counter.
Each has a 3rd field, eventNumItems (int) giving the number of items the customer has.
The <code>main</code> method reads this file and prints out the data
in unsorted order. It also computes the minimum eventTime value for
all the ALL_DONE events (if there are more than one) in a local
variable called <code>minAllDoneTime</code>.
</p>

<p> 
You are required to add two methods to the <code>EventQueue</code>. This class has a
constructor (provided). You are required to write two methods:
<code>insertEvent()</code> and <code>deleteEvents()</code>.
<ol>
<li> The <code>insertEvent()</code> method adds one event object to an eventQueue object.
This queue can be assumed to be sorted by time (ascending order, smallest to largest time value,
or earliest to letest time). We insert an event by dequeueing
events from eventQueue until we find the insertion place, add the new event and restore
the eventQueue to its original state (plus one event for the newly inserted event).
It will be necessary to use use a second queue to perform this operation. Because
you may (potentially) have to look at each event in the queue, this operation is <code>O(n)</code> 
for an <code>n</code> event queue. We also can use the queue's <code>toString()</code> method to
print out the queue contents before and after insertion of the queue. A
variable <code>debug</code> controls whether debugging printing occurs or not</li>
<li> The <code>deleteEvents()</code> method deletes all events with times >=
the lowest eventTime value for an ALL_DONE event (i.e. minDoneAllTime). 
That means there may be more than
one ALL_DONE event!!! If there are two or more ALL_DONE events with the minimum value,
we keep the first occurrence in the output list.
There may also be no ALL_DONE event, in which case a WARNING
message should be printed. Again, the queue's <code>toString()</code> method can
be used to print the queue contents before and after insertion.
As for <code>insertEvent</code>, a second queue may be needed to perform this O(n) operation.</li> 
</ol>
Lastly, the <code>EmptyCollectionException.java</code> exception class handles 
the possibility of trying to dequeue and empty queue.
</p>
<p>
For a small event file (5 events), we read one line at a time in Main.java,
and insert the event information into the eventQueue in the correct order. 
Then we delete all events in eventQueue with times greater than the smallest time
for any ALL_DONE event from
the sorted queue (but we do not delete the first ALL_DONE event at that time). 
For debugging purposes (debug=true in Main.java), we print the queue before 
and after each insert and delete operation. That code remains in the EventQueue.java 
file but the 2 places where insertion code and deletion code has been removed are
indicated by comments. Put you code there.
The debug output can be verbose,
in that case set the debug variable to false (debug=false in Main.java)
to reduce this output significantly.
</p>
 <p>
Only your <code>EventCode.java</code> file set to read
<code>ass3_events2015.txt</code> is required.

<p>
For our small event file we get:
