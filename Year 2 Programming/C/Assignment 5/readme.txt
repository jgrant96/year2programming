To make the program you should use the make utility.
The utility will compile the program according to specifications in the makefile. Please keep everything in the same directory.

--USING THE PROGRAM--

The program will take 4 arguments. Please enter the program name followed by three real numbers. The format is:

operation real.1 imaginary.1 real.2 imaginary.2

The first number will be stored as the real part of the first complex number.
The second number will be stored as the imaginary part of the first complex number.
